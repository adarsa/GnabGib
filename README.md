# R--predictive-modelling

I will add in this repository my work on different learning algorithms and data modelling in R.

1.tslm_dynamic
Implementation of tslm model for a data with unknown column names(independent variables)

When we try to run a  dynamically choosen data for the tslm in forecast package, conversion of the dependent variable to timeseries and choosing column names to build the regression is implemented here. 

Packages used
Forecastâ€‹ : Provides the necessary functionality of converting and evaluating the data for time series analysis. The models that are implemented in the code use the library function provided by this package.
